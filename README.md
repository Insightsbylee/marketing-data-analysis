## 🔍 Key Tasks Completed
- Checked and handled missing values across all columns  
- Filled missing values in product_type_id and product_length using the *mean*  
- Replaced missing text values with "Unknown"  
- Replaced missing date values with 01/01/2025 using Excel IF logic  
- Renamed and reverted the filled date column to original name  
- Standardized all column names to lowercase with underscores
